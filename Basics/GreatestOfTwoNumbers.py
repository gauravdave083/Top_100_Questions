# Find the Greatest of the Two Numbers
# Given two integer inputs as number1 and number2, the objective is to find the largest among the two. Therefore weâ€™ll   write a code to Find the Greatest of the Two Numbers in Python Language.

# Example
# Input : 20 40
# Output : 40

# We will use 3 methods to solve the above question

# Method 1: Using if-else Statements
# Method 2: Using Ternary Operator
# Method 3: Using inbuilt max() Function

num1, num2 = 20, 30
if num1>num2:
    print(num1)
else:
    print(num2)
