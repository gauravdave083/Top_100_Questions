# Find the Sum of the Numbers in a Given Range
# Given two integer inputs as the range [ low , high ], the objective is to find the sum of the numbers that lay in the intervals given by the integer inputs. Therefore weâ€™ll write a code to Find the Sum of the Numbers in a Given Range in Python Language.

# Example
# Input : 2 5
# Output : 14



# Brute Force

low, high = 2, 5
sum = 0

for i in range(low, high+1):
    sum+=i
print(sum)
