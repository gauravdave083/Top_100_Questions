# Check if a Year is a Leap Year or Not in Python
# Given an integer input year, the objective of the code is to Check if a Year is a Leap Year or Not in Python Language. To do so  weâ€™ll check if the year input satisfies either of the two conditions of leap year.

# Example
# Input : 2020
# Output : It's a Leap Year.


year = int(input("enter the year: "))

if (year % 400 == 0) or (year% 4==0 and year%100!=0):
     print("Leap Year")
else:
     print("Not A Leap Year")
