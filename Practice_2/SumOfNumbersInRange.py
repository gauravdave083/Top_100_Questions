# Find the Sum of the Numbers in a Given Range

# Given two integer inputs as the range [ low , high ], the objective is to find the sum of the numbers that lay in the intervals given by the integer inputs. Therefore weâ€™ll write a code to Find the Sum of the Numbers in a Given Range in Python Language.

# Example
# Input : 2 5
# Output : 14



# 1. Brute Force

num1, num2 = 2, 5
sum = 0

for i in range(num1, num2+1):
     sum += i

print(sum)
